  <strong>Serializers</strong> define the structure of the response.

<p>
  We use <a href="http://jsonapi-rb.org">jsonapi-rb</a> for serialization. If you're familiar
  with <a href="https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers">active_model_serializers</a>,
  the interface will seem very familiar. In fact, jsonapi-rb was created by one of the owners of that
  project.
