##### Walking Through Customization and Real-World Scenarios

In this section, we'll build an employee directory application.
If you're looking for a brief overview, head to the
[Quickstart]({{site.github.url}}/quickstart)
instead.

![employee_directory]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/employee_directory.gif)

If you get lost, you can view the code on Github:

* [Server](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory)
* [Client](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory)

*Note: each of these repos has a separate branch for step one,
step two, etc. View the latest branch for final code, or follow along
step-by-step*

The intent is to illustrate a variety of real-world use cases:

* Turning 3 database tables into one cohesive search grid.
* Customizing SQL queries.
* Ability to filter, sort, and paginate data.
* Total count
* Custom Serialization
* Nested CRUD of relationships, including validation errors.

*Note: to better understand the underlying code, we'll be avoiding use
of generators. Head to the [Quickstart]({{site.github.url}}/quickstart) for a guide on how
to automate much of the legwork here.*

# <a name="reads" href='#reads'>Reads</a>
## <a name="reads-setup" href='#reads-setup'>Setup</a>

We'll be creating an API for an Employee Directory. An `Employee` has many `Position`s (one of which is the *current* position), and a `Position` belongs to a `Department`.

Let's start with a basic foundation: an index endpoint (list multiple
entities) and a show (single entity) endpoint for an Employee model.

Code:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/controllers/employees_controller.rb
class EmployeesController < ApplicationController
  jsonapi resource: EmployeeResource

  def index
    render_jsonapi(Employee.all)
  end

  def show
    scope = jsonapi_scope(Employee.where(id: params[:id]))
    render_jsonapi(scope.resolve.first, scope: false)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/resources/employee_resource.rb
class EmployeeResource < ApplicationResource
  type :employees
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/serializers/serializable_employee.rb
class SerializableEmployee < JSONAPI::Serializable::Resource
  type :employees

  attribute :first_name
  attribute :last_name
  attribute :age
end
{% endhighlight %}

Tests:

{% highlight ruby %}
# spec/api/v1/employees/index_spec.rb
RSpec.describe 'v1/employees#index', type: :request do
  let!(:employee1) { create(:employee) }
  let!(:employee2) { create(:employee) }

  it 'lists employees' do
    get '/api/v1/employees'
    expect(json_ids(true)).to eq([employee1.id, employee2.id])
    assert_payload(:employee, employee1, json_items[0])
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
# spec/api/v1/employees/show_spec.rb
RSpec.describe 'v1/employees#show', type: :request do
  let!(:employee) { create(:employee) }

  it 'returns relevant employee' do
    get "/api/v1/employees/#{employee.id}"
    assert_payload(:employee, employee, json_item)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

A note on testing: these are full-stack [request specs](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails#request-specs). We seed the database using [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), randomizing data with [faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker), then assert on the resulting JSON using [spec helpers](https://jsonapi-suite.github.io/jsonapi_spec_helpers).

You won't have to write *all* the tests you see here, some are simply for demonstrating the functionality.

## <a name="filtering" href='#filtering'>Filtering</a>

One line of code allows simple `WHERE` clauses. If the user tried to filter on something not whitelisted here, an error would be raised.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/master...step_1_add_filter)

## <a name="custom-filtering" href='#custom-filtering'>Custom Filtering</a>

Sometimes `WHERE` clauses are more complex, such as prefix queries. Here we'll query all employees whose age is greater than or equal to a given number.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_1_add_filter...step_2_add_custom_filter)

## <a name="sorting" href='#sorting'>Sorting</a>

Sorting comes for free, but here's a test for it. Decide as a team if we *actually* need to write a spec here, or if it's considered tested within the libraries.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_2_add_custom_filter...step_3_basic_sorting)

## <a name="custom-sorting" href='#custom-sorting'>Custom Sorting</a>

Sometimes we need more than a simple `ORDER BY` clause, for example maybe we need to join on another table. In this example, we switch from Postgres's default case-sensitive query to a case in-sensitive one...but only for the `first_name` field.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_3_basic_sorting...step_4_custom_sorting)

## <a name="pagination" href='#pagination'>Pagination</a>

Pagination also comes for free, so once again we'll have to decide if writing a spec like this is worth the bother.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_4_custom_sorting...step_5_pagination)

## <a name="custom-pagination" href='#custom-pagination'>Custom Pagination</a>

By default we use the [Kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) library for pagination. This shows how we could instead sub-out Kaminari and replace it with [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate)

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_5_pagination...step_6_custom_pagination)

## <a name="statistics" href='#statistics'>Statistics</a>

For default statistics, (`count`, `sum`, `average`, `maximum` and `minimum`), simply specify the field and statistic.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_6_custom_pagination...step_7_stats)

## <a name="custom-statistics" href='#custom-statistics'>Custom Statistics</a>

Here we add a `median` statistic to show non-standard custom statistic usage.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_7_stats...step_8_custom_stats)

## <a name="custom-serialization" href='#custom-serialization'>Custom Serialization</a>

Let's say we wanted the employee's age to serialize `Thirty-Two` instead of `32` in JSON. Here we use a library to get the friendly-word doppleganger, and change the test to recognize this custom logic.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)

## <a name="has-many-association" href='#has-many-association'>Has-Many Association</a>

Get employees and their positions in one call. 

![github]({{site.github.url}}//assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/master...step_9_has_many)

## <a name="belongs-to" href='#belongs-to'>Belongs-To Association</a>

Get employees, positions, and the department for those positions in one call:

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_9_has_many...step_10_belongs_to)

## <a name="many-to-many" href='#many-to-many'>Many-to-Many</a>

In this example an `Employee` has many `Team`s and a `Team` has many `Employee`s.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_13_error_handling...many-to-many)

## <a name="resource-reuse" href='#resource-reuse'>Resource Re-Use</a>

In prior steps we created `PositionResource` and `DepartmentResource`. These objects may have custom sort logic, filter whitelists, etc - this configuration can be re-used if we need to add `/api/v1/positions` and `/api/v1/departments` endpoints.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_10_belongs_to...step_11_resource_reuse)

## <a name="fsp-associations" href='#fsp-associations'>Filter/Sort/Paginate Associations</a>

This comes for free. As long as the associated `Resource` knows how to do something, we can re-use that logic.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_11_resource_reuse...step_12_fsp_associations)

## <a name="error-handling" href='#error-handling'>Error Handling</a>

In this example we add global error handling, so any random error will return a [JSONAPI-compatible error response](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors). Then we customize that response for a specific scenario (the requested employee does not exist).

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)

# <a name="writes" href='#writes'>Writes</a>

## <a name="basic-create" href='#basic-create'>Basic Create</a>

Basic example without validations or strong parameters.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/bump_gemfile_for_writes...step_14_create)

## <a name="validations" href='#validations'>Validations</a>

Validations are basic, vanilla Rails code. When there is a validation error, we return a jsonapi-compatible error respone.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_14_create...step_15_validations)

## <a name="strong-resources" href='#strong-resources'>Strong Resources</a>

The biggest problem with `strong_parameters` is that we might want to create an employee from the `/employees` endpoint, or we might want to create a position with an employee at the same time from `/positions`. Maintaining the same strong parameter hash across a number of places is difficult.

Instead we use `strong_resources` to define the parameter template *once*, and re-use. This has the added benefit of being built on top of [stronger_parameters](https://github.com/zendesk/stronger_parameters), which gives us type checking and coercion.

Note: `strong_resources` requires Rails.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_15_validations...step_16_strong_resources)

## <a name="basic-update" href='#basic-update'>Basic Update</a>

Looks very similar to `create`.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/compare/step_16_strong_resources...step_17_basic_update)

## <a name="basic-destroy" href='#basic-destroy'>Basic Destroy</a>

More or less basic Rails.

## <a name="customizing-persistence" href='#customizing-persistence'>Customizing Persistence</a>

So far we've shown `ActiveRecord`. What if we wanted to use a different ORM, or ElasticSearch? What if we wanted 'side effects' such as "send a confirmation email after creating the user"?

This code shows how to customize `create/update/destroy`. In this example we're simply logging the action, but you could do whatever you want here as long as you return an instance of the object. Just like with reads, if any of this code becomes duplicative across `Resource` objects you could move it into a common `Adapter`.

## <a name="association-writes" href='#association-writes'>Association Writes</a>

### <a name="nested-creates" href='#nested-creates'>Nested Creates</a>

Think Rails' `accepts_nested_attributes_for`, but not coupled to Rails or ActiveRecord. Here we create an `Employee`, a `Position` for the employee, and a `Department` for the position in one call. This is helpful when dealing with nested forms!

Once again, note how our `strong_resources` can be shared across controllers.

### <a name="nested-updates" href='#nested-updates'>Nested Updates</a>

We got this for free, here's a spec!

### <a name="nested-destroys" href='#nested-destroys'>Nested Destroys</a>

We get this for free, though we have to explicitly tell `strong_resources` that destroys are allowed from this endpoint.

Note destroy will do two things: delete the object, and make the foreign key on the corresponding child in the payload `null`.

### <a name="disassociations" href='#disassociations'>Disassociations</a>

`destroy` actually deletes objects, what if we want to simply disassociate the objects by making the foreign key `null`? We get this for free, too.

### <a name="usage-without-activerecord" href='#usage-without-activerecord'>Usage without ActiveRecord</a>

Let's say the departments come from a service call. Here's the change to
the `/departments` endpoint.

Make the model a PORO:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/models/position.rb

# belongs_to :department, optional: true
attr_accessor :department
{% endhighlight %}

Use `{}` as our base scope instead of `ActiveRecord::Relation`:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/controllers/departments_controller.rb
def index
  # render_jsonapi(Department.all)
  render_jsonapi({})
end
{% endhighlight %}

Customize `resolve` for the new hash-based scope:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/resources/department_resource.rb
use_adapter JsonapiCompliable::Adapters::Null

def resolve(scope)
  Department.where(scope)
end
{% endhighlight %}

`Department.where` is our contract for resolving the scope. The underlying `Department` code could use an HTTP client, alternate datastore, what-have-you.

Let's also change our code for sideloading departments at `/api/v1/employees?include=departments`:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/resources/position_resource.rb

# belongs_to :department,
#   scope: -> { Department.all },
#   foreign_key: :department_id,
#   resource: DepartmentResource

allow_sideload :department, resource: DepartmentResource do
  scope do |employees|
    Department.where(employee_id: employees.map(&:id))
  end

  assign do |employees, departments|
    employees.each do |e|
      e.department = departments.find { |d| d.employee_id == e.id }
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, we're delving into a lower-level DSL to customize. You
probably want to package up these changes into an [Adapter](https://jsonapi-suite.github.io/jsonapi_compliable/JsonapiCompliable/Adapters/Abstract.html). The `ActiveRecord` adapter is simple packaging up similar low-level defaults. Your app may require an `HTTPAdapter` or `ServiceAdapter`, or you can make one-off customizations as shown above.

# <a name="elasticsearch" href='#elasticsearch'>ElasticSearch</a>

Similar to a service call, here's how we might incorporate the elasticsearch [trample](https://github.com/richmolj/trample) gem.

Make our base scope an instance of our Trample client:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/controllers/employees_controller.rb
  def index
    # render_jsonapi(Employee.all)
    render_jsonapi(Search::Employee.new)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Customize the resource using the Trample Client API:

{% highlight ruby %}
# app/resources/employee_resource.rb
use_adapter JsonapiCompliable::Adapters::Null

allow_filter :first_name do |scope, value|
  scope.condition(:first_name).eq(value)
end

allow_filter :first_name_prefix do |scope, value|
  scope.condition(:first_name).starts_with(value)
end

def resolve(scope)
  scope.query!
  scope.results
end
{% endhighlight %}

Once again, you probably want to package these changes into an [Adapter](https://jsonapi-suite.github.io/jsonapi_compliable/JsonapiCompliable/Adapters/Abstract.html).

# <a name="client-side" href='#client-side'>Client-Side</a>

## <a name="jsorm" href='#jsorm'>JSORM</a>

There are number of [jsonapi clients](http://jsonapi.org/implementations/) in a variety of languages. Here we'll be using [JSORM](/js/home) - an ActiveRecord-style ORM that can be used from Node or the browser. It's been custom-built to work with JSONAPI Suite enhancements.

This will fetch an employee with id 123, their last 3 positions where the title starts with 'dev', and the departments for those positions.

We'll use typescript for this example, though we could use vanilla JS just as well. First define our models (additional client-side business logic can go in these classes):

{% highlight typescript %}
import { JSORMBase, Model, Attr, HasMany, BelongsTo } from "jsorm"

@Model()
class ApplicationRecord extends JSORMBase {
  static baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000"
  static apiNamespace = "/api/v1"
}

@Model()
class Employee extends ApplicationRecord {
  static jsonapiType = "people"

  @Attr() firstName: string
  @Attr() lastName: string
  @Attr() age: number

  @HasMany() positions: Position[]
}

@Model()
class Position extends ApplicationRecord {
  static jsonapiType = "positions"

  @Attr() title: string

  @BelongsTo() department: Department[]
}

@Model()
class Department extends ApplicationRecord {
  static jsonapiType = "departments"

  @Attr() name: string
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now fetch the data in one call:

{% highlight javascript %}
let positionScope = Position
  .where({ title_prefix: "dev" })
  .order({ created_at: "desc" })

let scope = Employee
  .includes({ positions: "department" })
  .merge({ positions: positionScope })

let employee = (await scope.find(123)).data
// access data like so in HTML:
// employee.positions[0].department.name
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Read the JSORM documentation here](/js/home)

## <a name="vue" href='#vue'>VueJS Sample Application</a>

<img style="width: 100%" src="{{site.github.url}}/assets/img/vue_logo.png" alt="vue" />

**JSORM can be used with the client-side framework of your choice**. To give an example of real-world usage, we've created a demo application using
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). Vue is lightweight and provides the
bare-bones we need to illustrate JSONAPI and JSORM in action.

This will point to a [slightly-tweaked branch](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee_directory/tree/prepare_clientside) of the server-side API
above.

Let's create our app.

### Step 0: Setup

We've started with a basic Vue app configured with Webpack. None of this
is JSONAPI-specific, just boilerplate to get started quickly.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Branch on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/tree/step_0_setup)

### Step 1: Models

We'll start by defining our models, which should look very familiar if
you've worked with `ActiveRecord`. Again, see the [JSORM
documentation](/js/home) if any of this looks confusing to you.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_0_setup...step_1_models)

### Step 2: Data Grid

We'll add a simple data grid to our page listing all `Employee`s. This
will turn into a search grid, but for now we're simply loading employees
via `Employee.all()`

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_1_models...step_2_data_grid)

### Step 3: Adding Relationships

Here we've added a `currentPosition` relationship to avoid fetching
excess data from the server. When the page loads we fetch the
employees, current positions for those employees, and the departments for those positions.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_2_data_grid...step_3_includes)

### Step 4: Filtering

Here we've added a bit of state to the page, `query`, which will be
bound to the form inputs. We pass `query` to `Employee.where` to
successfully query employees by first and last name.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_3_includes...step_4_filtering)

### Step 5: Sorting

Just like with filters, we add a bit of state to our page to track
sorting parameters. When the user clicks a table header, we'll update
that state and pass it to our query.


![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_4_filtering...step_5_sorting)

### Step 6: Stats

A JSORM promise returns a `response` object with a `data` key - the
model instance(s) we've been referencing so far. It also returns a
`meta` key that reflects the [meta](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta) section of the JSONAPI response.

Here we'll request the total count of employees in our query to the
server, grab that total count from `meta`, and bind it to the page as
`totalCount`

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_5_sorting...step_6_stats)

### Step 7: Pagination

Building on what we've already done, we can apply a similar pattern for
pagination. We add the `currentPage` state and alter it when the user
clicks pagination links. We use `currentPage` and `totalCount` to figure
out if we should display previous/next page links.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_6_stats...step_7_pagination)

### Step 8: Basic Form Setup

We'll be adding a form to create and update employees. This step just
adds the relevant HTML and Vue code to get set up, before involving
JSORM.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_7_pagination...step_8_basic_form_setup)

### Step 9: Dropdowns

Our form will submit employees, positions and departments in a single
request. We associate a position to an existing department through a
`select` dropdown. To populate that dropdown, we fetch all departments
from the server and bind it to the `select`.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_8_basic_form_setup...step_9_dropdown)

### Step 10: Nested Create/Update

This step simply binds our instantiated models to the form. When the
form is submitted, we save everything in a single one-line request.

After the form submission, we could edit the form and submit again -
JSORM will know to `PATCH` an update to the appropriate URL
automatically.

Note we could also edit our search to immediately reflect the new
data...but this is more Vue-specific than anything to do with JSORM, so
we'll hold off until the last step.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_9_dropdown...step_10_nested_create)

### Step 11: Validations

Our server-side code will automatically handle validation errors and
give us a well-formatted response. JSORM will read that response and
automatically apply `error` objects to our model instances. Here we
display simple error messages without involving any JS code.

![github]({{site.github.url}}/assets/img/GitHub-Mark-32px.png)
[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_10_nested_create...step_11_validations)

### Step 12: Nested Destroy

This step adds buttons to our form that will add and remove positions
for a given employee. To add, we simply `push` a new `Employee` onto the
relationship array. To remove, we set `isMarkedForDestruction = true`,
which allows for "unsaved deleted records". This follows a similar
pattern to one introduced in Ember Data, [explained here](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2015/09/02/ember-data-2-0-released.html#toc_unsaved-deleted-records).

Note that if we wanted to **disassociate** the position rather than
**destroying** the underlying record, we could use
`position.isMarkedForDisassociation = true`.

[View the Diff on Github](https://github.com/jsonapi-suite/employee-directory-vue/compare/step_10_nested_create...step_11_validations)

### Step 13: VueJS Wrap-up

Our final step adds some Vue-specific functionality - we add an
`EventBus` to allow selecting an employee from the grid and binding it
